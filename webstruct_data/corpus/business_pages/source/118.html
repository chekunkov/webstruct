                     <div class="postmetadata">Posted by:  <strong>Hugh Stearns</strong>  Posted on: August 21st, 2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a data-disqus-identifier="2302 http://stearnsdesignbuild.com/?p=2302" href="http://stearnsdesignbuild.com/home-improvements-that-make-things-worse/#disqus_thread" title="Comment on Home Improvements that Make Things Worse">4 Comments</a> </div>
                     <div class="entry"><p>This post is provided through our Friend Mark Healey. &nbsp;Look at comments to see where we disagree with one of the points made here. We could write a book on this topic. Unfortunately the things that make a home worse are often the norm.</p>
<p>Considering a major home renovation? Proceed cautiously â not all âupgradesâ increase your homeâs value or improve your lifestyle as much as youâd expect. Worse, some may even have a negative effect!</p>
<h2>Short-sighted Improvements</h2>
<p>When renovating, the length of time you plan to keep the property should influence the sort of upgrades you choose. If you plan to sell in just a few years, avoid making very expensive, very trendy or very eccentric changes. For example:</p>
<h3>The Super Duper Aquarium</h3>
<p>We get it. You like the show <i>Tanked.</i> You like water and colorful living things. So why not create your own show-stopping gee-whiz fishy fantasy and install a built-in aquarium?</p>
<ul>
<li>A large aquarium is like an in-ground pool. Except itâs inside your house. Nothing says âYour weekends will never again be your ownâ to home buyers like huge bodies of water.</li>
<li>Theyâre not cheap, costing about $10,000 at the low end to hundreds of thousands at the high end. You will not get this money back, and maintenance runs between $1 and $4 per gallon, per month.</li>
<li>When you sell your house, youâre likely to be asked to tear out the tank, which could cost hundreds or thousands of dollars.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Amazing Home Entertainment System</h3>
<p>Built-in home theatre systems have waned in popularity, largely due to a fact of electronic life â the equipment goes from latest-and-greatest technology to completely-obsolete-white-elephant faster than Taylor Swift can replace a boyfriend. This isnât a big deal when you can take the old gear off your shelf and replace it with new, but itâs a problem when you paid $60,000 to have it surgically implanted into your walls.</p>
<p>In addition, many folks dislike theatre seating (isnât that why Netflix is so popular?). Potential home buyers wonât want the expense or hassle of gutting the space. You may get LESS for your home after installing the projection room than you otherwise would have, or the property may take longer to sell.</p>
<h3>The âSpecialâ Room</h3>
<p>Other pricy add-ons that donât get nearly the love that their owners would like are wine cellars / tasting rooms, billiard rooms, over-the-top outdoor kitchens, model train rooms, saunas and indoor sport courts. On the other hand, comfortable, versatile rooms with lots of storage that can morph into craft rooms, offices, home gyms, guest quarters or playrooms can help your home appeal to more people.</p>
<h2>Good Improvements Gone Bad</h2>
<p>The longer you plan to own your home, the less concerned you need be with a buyerâs taste or the return on investment a specific project offers Even if you plan to keep your property a long time and are upgrading for your own pleasure, however, there are pitfalls. Most of these are the result of cutting corners or not doing enough homework.</p>
<h3>The Unpermitted Renovation</h3>
<p>Your local government and even your neighbors may have some say in what you do with your house. There may be architectural committees to please, CC and Rs to comply with and inspections to pass. Adding that screen porch, mother-in-law unit or deck without a permit could get you in hot water, with penalties ranging from fines to having to remove your changes. With unpermitted work, you could have a very hard time selling or <a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/mortgage-refinance-index?topsell=qf">refinancing your house</a>, should you wish to do so. Homeowner associations (HOAs) can also levy fines, place liens against your home and even foreclose.</p>
<h3>The Mismatched Addition</h3>
<p>Adding onto your home without the advice of an architect can be very expensive in the long run. Thatâs when you get misguided creations like Mediterranean villa welded to Midwestern ranch. Or huge rectangular growths that dwarf the original houses theyâre attached to. Spend a little now so people wonât laugh and point every time they drive by your house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Unusable Enhancement</h3>
<p>Then there are the improvements that only <i>seem </i>like improvements. They arise from romantic dreams in which everyone is watching the sun go down or come up, sipping an appropriate beverage â completely forgetting that the kitchen is two flights below the designated sipping deck off the master suite, and that three toddlers allow no sipping of anything while they are awake. In this category youâll also find the sun porch in Phoenix, the water feature in Fairbanks and the oversized garage in downtown San Francisco.</p>
<p>Before you make major changes to your house, get some advice â from a local real estate pro, a reputable builder and someone you donât live with who knows you really well â these folks can keep you from making changes that wonât sell, wonât work or wonât fulfill your fantasies.</p>

<p>You will not often hear me saying something nice about an insurance company.&nbsp; But here goes. <a href="http://www.allstate.com/tools-and-resources/maintenance-reminder.aspx">All Stateâs Maintenance reminder</a> provides you with home maintenance reminders. This is a very smart move on their part.&nbsp; So often we are hired to do expensive repairs that could have been avoided with a very small amount of maintenance. Homeowners often lack the confidence to tackle home maintenance task. Some of these tasks are best done by a professional, but many can easily be done by a homeowner.&nbsp; But even if you choose to pay a professional do everything down to changing your air filter, it will be cheaper to have the maintenance done than not done.&nbsp; All States maintenance reminder can help you stay on top of these tasks.</p>
<p>By the way, <a href="mailto:https://www.facebook.com/StearnsDesignBuild">our Facebook page</a> also offers reminders and instruction on doing household maintenance.&nbsp; Like us and we, too, will be an aid to helping maintain your home. Thanks to Mark Healey for bringing this to my attention.</p>

                     <div class="entry"><p><a href="http://stearnsdesignbuild.com/wp-content/uploads/ceiling-fan.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2238" alt="ceiling fan" src="http://stearnsdesignbuild.com/wp-content/uploads/ceiling-fan.jpg" height="200" width="300"></a>The intention of using ceiling fans is to conserve energy. But there are three ways that ceiling fans frequently cause people to waste energy and money.</p>
<p>The most common wasteful infraction is leaving the ceiling fan on when no one is in the room. Ceiling fans cool by moving air across the skin. If there is no skin in the room it cannot work. And, in fact, the fan motor is adding heat to a room. In a recent article on Greenbuildingadvisor.com Carl Seville indicated that fan motors can exceed 100 degrees when running. But a quality Energy Star fan will run much cooler. We recommend using Energy star fixtures and appliances whenever possible.</p>
<p>The second way that a fan can cause energy waste is if the thermostat is not adjusted up. Ceiling fans should allow you to adjust your temperature up by about two degrees, which will reduce cooling costs in College station and Bryan by about 14%. If you do not do that, you are just increasing your energy bill by using the fans. If the temperature is set for people in the kitchen where there is no ceiling fan, then you should not run the fans in the other rooms. This becomes a design strategy that involves the zoning of the AC system and the placement of fans. For many families the optimal plan is to put fans in the bedrooms and only run them at night when people are sleeping. The thermostat should be programmed to raise the temperature at that time. Whether you are remodeling or building a custom home or just doing repairs, it is wise to design for energy savings.</p>
<p>The third way that people waste energy with their ceiling fans is by not having them set in the right direction. They should blow down in summer and up in the winter. While this will not completely negate the impact of the fan it will greatly diminish its benefit.</p>

<p>One of the very cool things that happens in Bryan every year is the Red Wasp Film Festival, which began in 2003. Founders Carol and Craig Conlee held the first festivals at 7F Lodge in Wellborn.</p>
<p>In 2006 Brazos Progressives partnered with Carol and Craig, and the festival moved to Conlee Auctions in downtown Bryan, TX, and 2008 the festival moved to Stage Center.</p>
<p>Carol Conlee came up with the name. When they owned 7F Lodge, where the first festivals were held. during the spring, the red wasps would return in droves, so Carol decided to make the âpeskyâ wasps part of the festival. It was one of her ways of making peace with her surroundings. She swears that although the wasps are still present in the environment during the spring they donât bother her any more.</p>
<p>Since 2006 The Festival has been under the capable direction of Krista May who has done a stellar job making sure that it has grown in stature and quality of film every year.&nbsp; Red Wasp 2013 will happen Friday, November 1, and Saturday, November 2, 2013, at StageCenter Theater in downtown Bryan. More information about film submissions, screening schedules, sponsors, and ticket information will be posted soon at <a href="http://redwasp.org/">redwasp.org</a>. Stay tuned</p>

<br>Vacuum the clothes dryerâs exhaust duct at least once a year. It is best to use rigid sheet metal ducting that goes straight out. This will reduce the fire hazard because the duct is less affected by heat and because it is less likely to build up dust.&nbsp; This will also help your clothes dry quicker saving on energy costs. If you have to use a flex duct try to avoid sharp turns in it.<p></p>

<p>At least once a month test your garage door opener to ensure that it reverses when it hits an obstruction and when its sensor beam is interrupted.</p>
