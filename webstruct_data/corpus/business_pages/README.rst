Here are webpages from different industries; most of them are
pages of small or medium US, UK and CA businesses. For each website
a "main", "contact", "locations", "about", "team" and one other page
are saved (some pages are missing for some of the websites). Pages are saved
to ``source`` folder using WebAnnotator_ Firefox extension
(without annotations), with ``<base>`` tag inserted.

Pages in ``annotated`` folder are annotated using WebAnnotator_
with ``webannotator.dtd`` scheme.
