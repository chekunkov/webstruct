Music has been shown to stimulate parts of the brain relating to reading, mathematics and emotional development.<br>
	              <br>
	              Research has shown that participation in musical activities at an early age can help to improve a childs learning ability and memory by stimulating different patterns of brain development.<br>
	              Music can help children to focus and control their bodies and is especially good in the development and improvement of  hand/eye co-ordination.<br>
	              <br>
	              Music can really improve confidence and self esteem.  Children who are involved in musical groups learn important life skills, such as how to relate to others, how to work as a team and appreciate the rewards that come from working together, and the development of leadership skills and discipline.<br>
	              <br>
	              Creating music is a fun way for children to show their individuality and really express themselves.<br>
	              At mini musicians we like to dance to music which can help with co-ordination, balance and rhythm and is also a good form of exercise.<br>
	              <br>
	              Music performance teaches young people to conquer fear and to take risks. A little anxiety is a good thing, and something that will occur often in life. Dealing with it early and often makes it less of a problem later. Risk-taking is essential if a child is to fully develop his or her potential. <br>
	              <br>
	              At mini musicians we aim to develop cultural understanding.  Children are introduced to a variety of music from different cultures and genres.  This exposure allows children to learn about and appreciate the differences and individuality of different cultures.<br>
	              <br>
	              Regular music classes will help children to develop a passion and life long love of music and the performing arts.
